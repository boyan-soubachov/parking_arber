# Parking Arber

Find when your colleagues (who have a parking allocation) happen to be off. Then be nice and ask them if you may use their bay while they're away.

**NB:** This was written in a couple of hours with the sole purpose of getting something working rather than following beautiful design principles. As such, a lot of it will make you cringe. If you want to improve it, I'll be happy to review your PR.

## Usage
`python main.py --date-from=2018-05-01 --date-to=2018-05-31` will give you the parking opportunities between the two dates (inclusive of both).
